# SSEC Voting App

A custom-built web application designed to modernize the student leadership election process and streamline school announcements. This project was developed as a functional extension/replica of my high school's old official website and was **successfully implemented and used during live voting day.**

## Project Overview
This repository contains a full-scale replica of my high school's website, featuring a dynamic **Announcements Blog** and an **Online Voting System**. 

The goal was to replace traditional voting methods with a digital interface where students could learn about candidates before casting their ballots.

### Key Features:
* **Announcement Blog:** A dedicated section for school updates (elections, programs, events) that links to full event details.
* **Candidate Profiles:** Interactive voting pages where users can click on a candidate's name to read their manifestos and vision for the school.
* **Multi-Category Voting:** Supports multiple leadership positions (prefects) in a single session.
* **Real-world Deployment:** Successfully used by the student body for official school elections.

## Technical Journey
I built this project over **two weeks** after having taught myself web development through the **Mimo** app. At the time, I was working without the help of AI or formal instruction, relying on self-study and community resources like Stack Overflow.

### Built With:
* **HTML5:** For the structure and replica of the school's layout.
* **CSS3:** For styling, ensuring the replica looked identical to the official site.
* **JavaScript:** To handle the voting logic, candidate profile transitions, and form resets.

### Challenges & Lessons Learned:
* **Data Persistence:** Since this was a front-end focused build without a database back-end, I designed the workflow to be supervised. We implemented a manual oversight system with teachers to ensure vote integrity and prevent double-voting.
* **Self-Taught Logic:** As someone still learning JavaScript at the time, I had to manually figure out how to manage state between the candidate profiles and the voting form.
* **Problem Solving:** Facing technical hurdles with little outside help pushed me to become a more resilient developer.

## How it Works
1.  **Discover:** Students browse the "Announcements" section to see upcoming events or elections.
2.  **Research:** On the voting page, clicking a candidate opens their personal statement/profile.
3.  **Vote:** Users return to the main list to select their choice and submit.
4.  **Reset:** The form can be cleared for the next student to ensure a continuous flow on voting day.
